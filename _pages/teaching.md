I served as a teaching assistant for the following courses at MSU. I enjoy helping students master skills on analytical thinking, mathematics, and programming.

### Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University
- CSE 231: [Introduction to Programming](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/) (Spring 2017, Spring 2018, Fall 2018)
- CSE 260: [Discrete Structures in Computer Science](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse260/) (Fall 2017)

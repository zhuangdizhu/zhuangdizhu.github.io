I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, advised by [Prof. Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/).

Short Biography
=====

My research interest resides in the general area of machine learning and its practical applications. I am particularly focusing on designing principled algorithms for effective **knowledge transfer** across different domains.
A broader research interest covers ***Reinforcement Learning*** and ***Federated Machine Learning***.
My previous research experiences includes  ***systems*** and ***wireless networking***.

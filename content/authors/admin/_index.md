I am Zhu, Zhuangdi (朱 [庄](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou)[翟](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi)). I am currently a senior Data & Applied Scientist working with Microsoft. I received my PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, advised by [Professor Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/). I am an alumni member of the [ILLIDAN Lab@MSU](https://illidanlab.github.io/).

My research interest resides in both applied and fundamental *machine learning*.  I am dedicated to developing *principled* algorithms that facilitate  *knowledge transfer* across domains. My current research focuses on *Reinforcement Learning* and *Federated Learning*. My previous research involves *systems*, *scheduling*, and *wireless networking*. Some of my selected research topics:


* **Sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning**  from [partially observable](/publication/opolo) and [suboptimal](/publication/sail) resource.
* **Federated Learning** with [*data*](/publication/fedgen) and [*system*](/publication/fedrescue) heterogeneity.
*  **Robust** and **Fair** learning with [unsupervised data](/publication/ruda) and [distributed devices](/publication/fedab).
